toc::[]

== Development

=== Setup

The dApp requires artifacts of the contracts deployed to the development environment.
To fetch the latest artifacts run `npm run setup`. The command will download files
stored in the Google Cloud. For initial configuration of the `gcloud` please refer
to the https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/master/infrastructure/kube/keep-dev/kube-setup.org#first-time-with-this-environment[instructions].

=== Run

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

== Deployment

Currently the dApp, and its landing page, are deployed using Firebase to
tbtc.network on the `tbtc-prod` GCP project and cluster. Deploying a new build
involves two steps:

* `npm run publish` builds a static version of the site to `build/`
* `firebase deploy` deploys the contents of `build/` to firebase

If the local machine hasn't authed to firebase, `firebase deploy` should prompt
for login. If the logged in user isn't authorized to run a deploy, check to see
if that authorization can be added.

== Docker

To build a Docker image execute:
```sh
docker build . -t tbtc-dapp
```

To run the Docker image execute:
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 tbtc-dapp
```

This will expose the app under http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080].

== Internal TestNet

To access the internal tBTC TestNet you need to be connected to it via VPN.
Contracts with which the app is interacting are deployed under the following
addresses:

=== MetaMask

Add custom network to your MetaMask:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| **RPC URL**| `http://eth-tx-node.default.svc.cluster.local:8545`
